# Emoji Kitchen

![kitchen_icon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d2bb32-811c-479f-beeb-b4608c294668)

A standalone Android app for Emoji Kitchen using [@arnav-kr's Emoji Kitchen API](https://emoji-kitchen.vercel.app/) that doesn't need Gboard.

Why?
1. I don't use Gboard
2. I think it's funny
3. I wanted to make an app
