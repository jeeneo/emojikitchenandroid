# Kitchen

A (lazyly coded) standalone Android app for Emoji Kitchen using [@arnav-kr's Emoji Kitchen API](https://emoji-kitchen.vercel.app/)

Expect some bugs, this is the first android app I've made and I used AndroidIDE for most of it ðŸ¤·

I hope to at one point move from using the API to supporting something like what https://emojikitchen.dev uses, but an 80mb json file for such a simple app is a bit much

It's easy to compile or use one from the releases tab

clone, `cd android`, `gradle build` (ymmv)
